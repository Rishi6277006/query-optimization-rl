This project demonstrates how **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** can be used to optimize SQL query execution plans in a database environment. The goal is to reduce query execution costs by dynamically adjusting query planner parameters such as join methods, index usage, and memory allocation.

## **Overview**
Query optimization is a critical aspect of database systems, as it directly impacts performance. Traditional query optimizers rely on static rules and cost models, which may not always produce the most efficient execution plans. This project explores the use of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to dynamically optimize query execution plans based on real-time feedback.

The RL agent interacts with a PostgreSQL database and learns to adjust query planner parameters (e.g., enabling/disabling hash joins, index scans, etc.) to minimize query execution costs. The project uses the **TPC-H benchmark dataset** for training and evaluation.

## **Features**
- **Reinforcement Learning Environment**: A custom Gym environment for query optimization.
- **Q-Learning Agent**: Implements a Q-learning algorithm to optimize query execution plans.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Connects to a PostgreSQL database to execute and analyze queries.
- **Dynamic Query Tuning**: Adjusts query planner parameters (e.g., `enable_hashjoin`, `enable_indexscan`, `work_mem`) to reduce execution costs.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes scripts for training the RL agent and evaluating its performance on test queries.

## **Installation**
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/query-optimization-rl.git
   cd query-optimization-rl
Set up a PostgreSQL database:
Install PostgreSQL and create a database (e.g., tpch_db).
Load the TPC-H dataset using the provided script (load_tcp_h.py).
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script:
bash
Copy
python src/train_rl_agent.py
Usage

1. Training the RL Agent

To train the RL agent, run the following command:

bash
Copy
python src/train_rl_agent.py
The agent will interact with the PostgreSQL database, optimize query execution plans, and save the trained Q-table.

2. Evaluating the Agent

To evaluate the trained agent on test queries, use the following script:

bash
Copy
python src/test_environment.py
3. Custom Queries

You can modify the test queries in src/test_environment.py to evaluate the agent on different workloads.

Future Work

Deep Reinforcement Learning: Replace Q-learning with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Policy Gradient methods for better performance.
State Space Refinement: Experiment with additional state features (e.g., query complexity, database statistics).
Multi-Query Optimization: Extend the agent to optimize multiple queries simultaneously.
Integration with Real Databases: Test the agent on real-world database workloads.
